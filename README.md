# FourteenFish - Full Stack Technical Assessment

# Overview

This app that stores information about medical professionals, such as doctors. Written in C# .NET app to build upon, along with seed data for a MySQL database.

### New Feature 1: Import data

Implement an import feature to parse, validate, and store new entries. Sample json file exists in root directory.

#### User stories

- As an admin, I want to import users from an external source so that I can migrate new users into our app.

#### Changes

- No database change
- Insert new route/controller
- Add import data repository for check duplicate data and insert or ignore.


#### Acceptance criteria:

- All doctors have a unique 7-digit GMC number.
- Given that admins may accidentally import the same data more than once, ensure new entries are only imported once.

### Feature 2: Add specialities

We have a requirement to record each doctor's medical specialities. Example specialities include:

- Anaesthetics
- Cardiology
- Dermatology
- Emergency Medicine
- General Practice (GP)
- Neurology
- Obstetrics and Gynaecology
- Ophthalmology
- Orthopaedic Surgery
- Psychiatry

#### User stories

- As an admin, I want to add and remove medical specialities so I can manage them in the system.
- As an admin, I want to associate an existing speciality with a doctor's profile so that we can record what specialities they can perform.
- As an admin, I want to see the specialities associated with a doctor when viewing their details page so that we know what specialities they can perform.

#### Acceptance criteria:

- Given that a doctor may have more than one speciality, admins should be able to associate a doctor with more than one.
- Given that a doctor may stop practising a speciality, admins should be able to remove them for a user.
- Given that an admin may make a mistake when adding a speciality name, updating the speciality should update it for all doctors associated with it.

How you implement these features is up to you.

You will have approximately 1 week to complete this task and should focus on an MVP. You can use as much or as little time as you deem necessary to demonstrate your understanding of the problem, your range of skills, and approach to problem solving.

## Evaluation

To evaluate your solution, we will test your import function using new data that follows the format of the sample data you have been provided. Please provide instructions if any setup or changes are required in order for your solution to work.

We will look at the design, structure, and implementation of your solution. We would like to see good practices, taking into account robustness, extensibility, readability, documentation, etc.

If there are any ideas that you would have liked to implement if you had more time, we would love to hear about it.

## Submitting your solution

Create a public Github repository and push your solution, including any documentation you feel is necessary. Commit often - we would rather see a history of trial and error than a single monolithic push. When youâ€™re finished, please send us the URL to the repository.
